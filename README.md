### UltraTDS Engine
Back to School, we made it through the 1st year! Now it is time to code a custom Engine, what?? Yes, we are making an engine for a specific game genre, Tower Defense in our case. So, each group contained about 4 people, in the roles of Engine, AI, and Graphics programmers. The lecturers encouraged us to explore new roles, so I took on Graphics programming. That meant I needed to deal with a 
graphics API from Microsoft, DirectX12, which was likely the most difficult part of my programme so far. More than graphics programming, however, I learnt something else: realistic project scoping. I was all over the place with research, trying to understand the whole picture before diving in, but that only slowed me down and in the end we went for ImGUI graphics. Therefore, our demo looks a bit silly, but the whole functinality is there: you can place towers wherever you want and you can stop enemies before they reach your tower. Great job from the AI and Engine programmers!

### Candy Chaos
The first inter-disciplinary work of my education happened in Block D. We successfully passed two stages of development, where half of the projects would be shut down and the remaining members would be assigned to successful ones. From a group of 3, we become 12, and it was not always smooth sailing. On the other hand, it was an amazing experience to work with such talented people towards a common goal. The assignment was to take inspiration from a early 80s game, and we chose _Ghosts N Goblins_. Of course, the artists changed the aesthetics and made it 3D, but the intense fast-paced run and gun is still there for those who dare try it. My main contributions were in the AI of one of the 3 enemy types: the seemingly harmless but savage **jawbreaker**. I will say no more, have a go at it and decide for yourself!

### Sonic goes Raspberry Pi
For Block C we got quite a task: Implement our own version of _Quake_ on the raspberry pi (3A), with its modest 1GB of RAM (About the same of a mobile phone). My planning went south when loading .obj and animating .md2 came into place, so I rescoped my project to be a 3D platformer instead. Unfortunately, it isn't possible for most people to run the game, since it is designed to be executed on the raspberry itself. Neverthless, I have included my final product presentation below.

### Tron
Assignment for Block B, when we first had to deal with matrices and graphics. From an incomplete framework, we needed to make a 2.5D Game , in other words, a 2D gameplay with 3D visuals. Making use of OpenGL and GLM, I pulled off a basic AI to race against the player, which isn't too clever but gets the job done. You can also play with a friend, just tell them it is similar to _Snake_ and they will get it.

### BeeHero
Intake assignment for education in NHTV, made in **Visual Studio 2015**. 
My first project using **C++**, this was a bit scary but really enjoyable. With the aid of SFML I managed to create an experience where you are the last bee of the hive, and it is up to you to ensure the colony's survival through the year. Play through Spring until Fall and stock up on honey for the winter! Simple but fun arcade gameplay will make sure you are smashing that space bar... Spoiler Alert! Oh, too late.

Extra: I took the freedom to produce the assets in Photoshop, pixel art is really fun!

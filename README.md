## Projects

2016
### BeeHero
Intake assignment for education in NHTV, made in **Visual Studio 2015**. 
My first project using **C++**, this was a bit scary but really enjoyable. With the aid of SFML I managed to create an experience where you are the last bee of the hive, and it is up to you to ensure the colony's survival through the year. Play through Spring until Fall and stock up on honey for the winter! Simple but fun arcade gameplay will make sure you are smashing that space bar... Spoiler Alert! Oh, too late.

Extra: I took the freedom to produce the assets in Photoshop, pixel art is really fun!

### Game Marmalades
Block B was quite special: It consisted of 3 _Game Marmalades_, which works like a Game Jam but spread out (therefore the word play), which means we work on each project the equivalent of 48h, but over 2 weeks so we can lead a healthy routine. In the end, we have a working prototype of a game that on each Marmalade has different constraints and challenges. Each Marmalade is meant to be a challenge for one of the three specializations: Programming, Art and Design. The focus of the Marmalades is: 

> Fast iteration and playable prototypes

#### GM1 - Programming Challenge
Have you ever wanted to cross a canyon with a cowboy pig on a barrel using a paint bucket? This is the first of the marmalades, the theme is _Custom Controllers_. We were given an Arduino and some components and told to make a controller with it. Of course, we had to customize them to our own needs and that resulted in an all sorts of concepts from differents teams. Since Year 2 is about experimenting new roles and risk taking, I decided to step in and be the Product Owner of the team. For the first time, I was taking a role in Production rather than Development, and that posed quite a challenge. So I had to write High Concept Document, Product Backlog, make presentations, lead team meetings, be on top of everyone's work and push the project towards the dream while maintaining a healthy team culture. However, I believe it was all worth it when I saw the end result: People having fun with our game. Together with the Scrum Master, we scoped the project so that people could playtest it before we made the final presentation. The result was stupendous, we were praised by the lecturers and others students for the sheer simplicity of the game and our ideal scoping, despite being one artist and two designers short (6 people instead of 9). Enough talking, check out the trailer below!

* _Production Role_
* _Tools: Unity, Arduino_
* _Time of Development: 3 weeks_

#### GM2 - Art Challenge
Given a set of themes and images, our team was assigned random image and theme to develop the game from. The Art challenge my team decided to go for was having a 2D character in a 3D world. The gameplay resembles the game Don't Starve - at least in terms of movement. The game is about a friendly bear that goes around hugging villagers, with a bizarre twist to it. I was in charge of:
* Character movement (8 directional movement and sprinting)
* Character Interaction
* UI: Hug Meter

### UltraTDS Engine
Back to School, we made it through the 1st year! Now it is time to code a custom Engine, what?? Yes, we are making an engine for a specific game genre, Tower Defense in our case. So, each group contained about 4 people, in the roles of Engine, AI, and Graphics programmers. The lecturers encouraged us to explore new roles, so I took on Graphics programming. That meant I needed to deal with a 
graphics API from Microsoft, DirectX12, which was likely the most difficult part of my programme so far. More than graphics programming, however, I learnt something else: realistic project scoping. I was all over the place with research, trying to understand the whole picture before diving in, but that only slowed me down and in the end we went for ImGUI graphics. Therefore, our demo looks a bit silly, but the whole functionality is there: you can place towers wherever you want and you can stop enemies before they reach your tower. Great job from the AI and Engine programmers!

### Candy Chaos
The first inter-disciplinary work of my education happened in Block D. We successfully passed two stages of development, where half of the projects would be shut down and the remaining members would be assigned to successful ones. From a group of 3, we become 12, and it was not always smooth sailing. On the other hand, it was an amazing experience to work with such talented people towards a common goal. The assignment was to take inspiration from a early 80s game, and we chose _Ghosts N Goblins_. Of course, the artists changed the aesthetics and made it 3D, but the intense fast-paced run and gun is still there for those who dare try it. My main contribution was in the AI of one of the 3 enemy types: the seemingly harmless but savage **jawbreaker**. I will say no more, have a go at it and decide for yourself!

* _Language: Unreal Blueprints_
* _Tools: Unreal Engine_
* _Time of Development: 8 weeks_

### Sonic goes Raspberry Pi
For Block C we got quite a task: Implement our own version of _Quake_ on the raspberry pi (3A), with its modest 1GB of RAM (About the same of a mobile phone). My planning went south when loading .obj and animating .md2 came into place, so I rescoped my project to be a 3D platformer instead. Unfortunately, it isn't possible for most people to run the game, since it is designed to be executed on the raspberry itself. Neverthless, I have included my final product presentation below.

* _Language: C++_
* _Tools: tinyObjLoader, VisualGDB_
* _Time of Development: 8 weeks_

### Tron
Assignment for Block B, when we first had to deal with matrices and graphics. From an incomplete framework, we needed to make a 2.5D Game , in other words, a 2D gameplay with 3D visuals. Making use of OpenGL and GLM, I pulled off a basic AI to race against the player, which isn't too clever but gets the job done. You can also play with a friend, just tell them it is similar to _Snake_ and they will get it.

* _Language: C++_
* _Tools: OpenGL, GLM_
* _Time of Development: 8 weeks_

### BeeHero
Intake assignment for education in NHTV, made in **Visual Studio 2015**. 
My first project using **C++**, this was a bit scary but really enjoyable. With the aid of SFML I managed to create an experience where you are the last bee of the hive, and it is up to you to ensure the colony's survival through the year. Play through Spring until Fall and stock up on honey for the winter! Simple but fun arcade gameplay will make sure you are smashing that space bar... Spoiler Alert! Oh, too late. 

* _Language: C++_
* _Tools: SFML_
* _Time of Development: 10 weeks_

Extra: I took the freedom to produce the assets in Photoshop, pixel art is really fun!

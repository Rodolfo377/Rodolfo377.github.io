### Sonic goes Raspberry Pi
For Block C we got quite a task: Implement our own version of _Quake_ on the raspberry pi (3A), with its modest 1GB of RAM (About the same of a mobile phone). My planning went south when loading .obj and animating .md2 came into place, so I rescoped my project to be a 3D platformer instead. Unfortunately, it isn't possible for most people to run the game, since it is designed to be executed on the raspberry itself. Neverthless, I have included my final product presentation below.

### Tron
Assignment for Block B, when we first had to deal with matrices and graphics. From an incomplete framework, we needed to make a 2.5D Game , in other words, a 2D gameplay with 3D visuals. Making use of OpenGL and GLM, I pulled off a basic AI to race against the player, which isn't too clever but gets the job done. You can also play with a friend, just tell them it is similar to _Snake_ and they will get it.

### BeeHero
Intake assignment for education in NHTV, made in **Visual Studio 2015**. 
My first project using **C++**, this was a bit scary but really enjoyable. With the aid of SFML I managed to create an experience where you are the last bee of the hive, and it is up to you to ensure the colony's survival through the year. Play through Spring until Fall and stock up on honey for the winter! Simple but fun arcade gameplay will make sure you are smashing that space bar... Spoiler Alert! Oh, too late.

Extra: I took the freedom to produce the assets in Photoshop, pixel art is really fun!
